Workflow

If creating a mods or mads record from scratch
	-use the form
	-create a record by hand and save in catalog_pending/(mods or mads depending)

If correcting a mods or mads record
	-if the change will not impact anything in the cite table (check table columns)
		-make change to record in catalog_data and push to github
	-if the change WILL change something in a cite table
		-make change and move the file to catalog_pending/corrections 

Table columns:
	#auth_col = "urn, authority_name, canonical_id, mads_file, alt_ids, related_works, urn_status, redirect_to, created_by, edited_by"
	#tg_col = "urn, textgroup, groupname_eng, has_mads, mads_possible, notes, urn_status, created_by, edited_by"
	#work_col = "urn, work, title_eng, orig_lang, notes, urn_status, created_by, edited_by"
	#vers_col = "urn, version, label_eng, desc_eng, type, has_mods, urn_status, redirect_to, member_of, created_by, edited_by"

!!! Big Questions/Problems !!!

-Do we want CTS urns in our MADS records?  Has been only CITE up until now: YES WANT CTS URNS

-Corrections to Mods records that would impact the CITE tables have been made in catalog_data, need to account for these and update the CITE tables
	-use commits from Alison/anyone on github to catalog_data to move those files to catalog_pending/corrections, or just run through those files one at a time, no need to physically move them...  Gets rid of the issue of how to tell what is a correction and what is a new file.  New files come from catalog_pending, corrections come from catalog_data.

issue 2-/Users/ada/catalog_pending/mods/Aelius Paetus/AeliusPaetus.GRF(Teubner).Fragmenta.mods.xml
-marked as 'editor' no 'creator'

-CassiusDio.Foster.AnnalsofRome-VolI.mods - Two tlgs?, has issue with finding author names

-/GeographiGraeciMinores.Vol1.mods.xml - if multiple authors (Descriptio Graci), should have an entry for each (and mods record?)

FIXED? -/GeographiGraeciMinores.Vol1.mods.xml -Mensura Totius Habitae Terrae missing a tlg, marked "Need to look up" In this case the new mods record that would be created needs to be moved to errors, not the whole record with all of the constituents 

-/serenus.Cimiano.LiberMedicinalis(English).mods.xml : should we worry about multiple creators in a record?

-/WilliamTyre.MedLatin.HistoriaRerum.Selections.mods.xml : Could not find an author name, please check the record. - No roleTerm given


!!!!  TO DO  !!!!
-Add ability to deal with CTS urns in MADS records
-account for 'x' in a tlg/phi/stoa id
-update method so corrections come from catalog_data as informed by commits to that repo

!!!!         !!!!
